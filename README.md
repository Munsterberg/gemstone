# Getting Started
The fastest way to use this as a boilerplate:

```
// Get the latest version
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Munsterberg/gemstone myAppName

// cd myAppName
cd myAppName

// Install dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

This project was heavily influenced by the [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

I also recommend installing nodemon globally in order to run node.js applications. It is a file watcher and restarts your app automatically.

Simply 

```
npm install nodemon -g

nodemon app.js
```
